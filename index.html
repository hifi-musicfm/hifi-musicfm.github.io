			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>We introduce a simple and fast text-controllable high-fidelity music generation and editing model.
				It operates on sequences of continuous latent representations from a quantizer-free Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) 48 kHz stereo codec that eliminates the information loss drawback of discrete representations.
				Based on a diffusion transformer architecture trained on a flow-matching objective, the model can generate diverse high quality stereo samples, with simple text descriptions.
				We also explore text-guided style transfer and editing and demonstrate the impressive performance of the model for a variety of music editing tasks.
				Evaluations are conducted on both objective and subjective metrics and demonstrate that the proposed model is not only superior to the evaluated baseline on a standard text-to-music benchmark but also benefits from impressive style-transfer capabilities that are inherent to the model design.
				Model implementation and weights will be publicly made available to foster further research on music editing.</p>
